### Computational Modeling Example: Teaching Kids Coding with Scratch

As part of the implementation plan, students will engage in hands-on coding activities using the visual programming language Scratch. In a simple game creation activity, students will design a character to navigate a maze using arrow key inputs. This exercise introduces coding fundamentals, such as variables, loops, and conditionals, through a visually intuitive interface. The character's movements will be controlled by drag-and-drop coding blocks, making the coding experience accessible and enjoyable for kids. The interactive nature of the game fosters problem-solving and logical thinking, laying the foundation for future exploration in computer science.

This coding example not only reinforces mathematical and logical concepts but also demonstrates the practical application of computational modeling in teaching kids coding within the context of collective behavior and game theory.
