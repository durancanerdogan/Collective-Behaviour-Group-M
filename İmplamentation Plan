# 5. Implementation Plan

## 5.1 Curriculum Integration

Game theory concepts will be woven into existing middle or high school mathematics topics, including probability, basic algebra, and logical reasoning. This approach aligns with educational standards and ensures a seamless integration into the existing curriculum.

## 5.2 Pedagogical Strategies

Engaging lectures, interactive discussions, and age-appropriate games will form the basis of instruction. Emphasis will be placed on relatable examples to ensure that students can connect game theory concepts to their everyday experiences.

## 5.3 Computational Modeling

To make the concepts tangible, students will engage in simple computational modeling using user-friendly tools like Scratch or educational game theory simulation platforms. This hands-on approach aims to demystify the abstract nature of game theory.

## 5.4 Assessment Methods

Assessment will focus on understanding and application. Projects, group activities, and short quizzes will evaluate students' grasp of game theory concepts and their ability to apply them in practical situations.
