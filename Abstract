## Abstract

This report explores the integration of game theory into mathematics education to enhance the understanding of collective behavior. The implementation focuses on engaging students through hands-on activities and computational modeling, fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The aim is to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications, providing a foundation for understanding strategic interactions in both mathematical and real-world contexts.
