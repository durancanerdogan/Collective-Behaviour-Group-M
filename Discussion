## Discussion

The discussion section interprets the results and explores their implications. The integration of game theory into mathematics education has proven successful in fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills among students. The hands-on approach, including computational modeling, has bridged the gap between theory and practice, providing students with a tangible understanding of strategic decision-making.

The study acknowledges challenges, such as the abstract nature of game theory for students, and proposes solutions, including interactive activities and relatable examples. Additionally, the discussion
