## Methods

1. **Curriculum Integration:**
   The study integrates game theory concepts into existing mathematics topics, including probability, basic algebra, and logical reasoning. By aligning with educational standards, this approach ensures a seamless integration of game theory into the curriculum. This integration is done in Turkish Curriculum for middle school. Guide book is given in Figure 1.

2. **Pedagogical Strategies:**
   Engaging lectures, interactive discussions, and age-appropriate games form the basis of instruction. The use of relatable examples helps connect game theory concepts to students' experiences, fostering a deeper understanding. Biomimicry Simulation - Beehive Decision-Making game could be given as an example.

   Furthermore, utilizing this game will enable us to elucidate the concept of biomimicry to students, fostering a deeper understanding of its connections.

3. **Computational Modeling:**
   To demystify abstract concepts, hands-on activities using user-friendly tools like Scratch or educational game theory simulations are implemented. This practical approach allows students to visually explore the outcomes of different strategies, reinforcing theoretical concepts. Most common and basic example could be jellybeans given in Figure 2.

   [Figure 2: Bee hive and “biomimicry” example hive city design]

   In the jellybeans example, we give an uncertified amount of jellybeans in a jar to students and ask them how many jelly beans are there. To understand the connection between collective behavior, we can check it in different topics.
