# Mathematics Education and Game Theory Integration Project

## Introduction
In this study, we conducted interviews with three high school students from different grade levels to explore the impact of integrating Mathematics Education and Game Theory using the programming tool Scratch. The goal was to make mathematics more engaging and to investigate its influence on students' understanding of collective behavior. The interviews were conducted in a virtual environment, acknowledging the brevity of the experiment and the potential limitations on the depth of the results.
