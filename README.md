Project Overview:
Our project focuses on the integration of game theory principles into mathematics education. The starting point for our research is the implementation report titled "Implementing Collective Behavior in Mathematics Education through Game Theory." This report explores the use of game theory concepts to enhance students' understanding of strategic decision-making in collective settings.

Project Plan:
Milestone 1 : Set up the GitHub repository, finalize team roles, and establish a clear structure for collaboration. Begin refining the existing report and identifying specific areas for expansion and improvement.

Milestone 2 : Expand and enhance the report based on feedback and additional research. Develop more detailed sections, including a comprehensive literature review and refined implementation strategies. Ensure all team members actively contribute to the project.

Milestone 3 : Finalize the comprehensive report. Include visuals, examples, and address any challenges encountered during the implementation. Conduct thorough testing of the educational methods proposed in the report and document the outcomes.

Repository Structure:
/docs: Contains project-related documents, including the report drafts and final versions.
/code: Stores any code snippets or computational models used during the implementation.
/images: Houses visual assets, graphs, and images used in the report.
/data: If applicable, store any datasets or supplementary data used in the project.
Progress Tracking:
Throughout the course, we will use this repository to track our progress. Regular updates will be made to the README.md file, summarizing achievements, challenges, and plans for the upcoming weeks.
