## Project Overview

Our project focuses on the integration of game theory principles into mathematics education. Starting with the report "Implementing Collective Behavior in Mathematics Education through Game Theory," we aim to enhance students' understanding of strategic decision-making in collective settings.

## Project Plan

### Milestone 1
🏗️ Set up the GitHub repository, finalize team roles, and establish a clear structure for collaboration. Begin refining the existing report and identifying specific areas for expansion and improvement.

### Milestone 2
📚 Expand and enhance the report based on feedback and additional research. Develop more detailed sections, including a comprehensive literature review and refined implementation strategies. Ensure all team members actively contribute to the project.

### Milestone 3
🎯 Finalize the comprehensive report. Include visuals, examples, and address any challenges encountered during the implementation. Conduct thorough testing of the educational methods proposed in the report and document the outcomes.

## Progress Tracking

Throughout the course, we will use this repository to track our progress. Regular updates will be made to the README.md file, summarizing achievements, challenges, and plans for the upcoming weeks.

# Virtual Traffic Simulation

## Overview
Welcome to Virtual Traffic Simulation! This project offers an automated experience where virtual cars move autonomously, creating dynamic traffic patterns on the screen. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the unique and sometimes unpredictable journey of virtual traffic.

## How to Play
- The cars move automatically, requiring no player controls.
- If the cars don't start initially, press the green flag again to initiate the simulation.

## Have Fun!
Experience the captivating visual spectacle of Virtual Traffic Simulation. Press the green flag and enjoy the virtual traffic unfold its patterns.
